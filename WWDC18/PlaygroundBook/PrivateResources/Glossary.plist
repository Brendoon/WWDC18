			<string>To determine the thrust (**B**), which is generated by the combustion gases expelled by the rocket nozzles, we need to think that the thrust is a function of the ratio of the mass of fuel ejected per unit time (**T**) and speed with that this ejection occurs in relation to the rocket (**V**).

 The initial acceleration imposed on the rocket by the thrust can also be calculated, since we already know that:
 
![Formula5](Formula5.png)
 
 For our experiment the acceleration of gravity will be **10 (m/sˆ2)**, so the initial acceleration imposed on the rocket by the thrust needs to be greater than it.</string>

			<string>The resultant of forces acting on a rocket is calculated by the difference between the thrust (directed up) and the weight of the rocket (directed down). For a rocket to rise it is necessary that the thrust generated by its motors to be greater than the force weight that acts on him.
 
 If we consider Newton&apos;s second law, which says that the force acting on a system is given by the product between its mass and the acceleration developed, we can write, in relation to a rising rocket:
 
 ![Formula3](Formula3.png)
 
 Where: **B** is the thrust; **W** is the weight of the rocket; **m** is the total mass of the rocket, including fuel; and **a** is the acceleration of the rocket at the moment it has mass **m**.

 **μs** is the the friction coefficient between the road and the tires.
 
 **g** is the acceleration of gravity.
 
 **r** is the radius of the curve.
 
 For our experiment we are going to use μs = **0.7** and g = **10 (m/sˆ2)**.</string>

			<string>An **unbanked curve** is simply a curve (or a turn) that lies flat on the ground (parallel to the horizontal). Whenever a car travels along such a curve, there is a force of friction that acts on the car to keep it turning in a circular pathway. Assuming that the tires of the car are stationary with respect to the ground (are not skidding or sliding), the force of static friction acts on the tires and point towards the center of the circular pathway created by the car. It is precisely this static frictional force that creates the centripetal force required to accelerate the car along the curved path. If the car&apos;s velocity is too high, the frictional force will not be large enough and the car will skid off the curve.</string>

			<string>**What does speed mean?**
 In everyday language, most people use the terms speed and velocity interchangeably. In physics, however, they do not have the same meaning, and they are distinct concepts. One major difference is that speed has no direction. Thus, speed is a scalar.
 **Average speed** is defined to be the change in position divided by the time of travel.
